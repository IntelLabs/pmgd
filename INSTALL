We have tested PMGD on Ubuntu systems and a version on Windows 7. But
the Windows compilation is not maintained at this point.


Dependencies:
The following dependencies must be met to correctly compile on Ubuntu 16.04: 
libjsoncpp-dev, flex, javacc, libbison-dev, openjdk-8-jdk
# sudo apt-get install flex libjsoncpp-dev javacc libbison-dev openjdk-8-jdk
You will need to set JAVA_HOME to point to your JDK


Compilation:
After that it is a make in the main folder.
The make file puts all the libraries in a lib/ folder.


Underlying file system:

PMGD has been developed for future PM-based systems which assumes load
store addresseability of PM space and persistent writes after cache
line flushes. Our current evaluation has been with PM emulators using
the Persistent Memory File System
https://github.com/linux-pmfs/pmfs
Any other PM-enabled file system that can provide the same functions
as PMFS and export a POSIX-compliant mmap call should work. We will
test this soon and update instructions here.

However, we have been using PMGD on an ext4-based file system at the risk
of sacrificing durability. The code when compiled on a system that does
not support PM, does not flush data to the disk on its own. The current
release expects applications to call msync to avoid disk write penalties
at small transaction boundaries.


How to copy a PMGD database:

Since PMGD uses mmap to a large virtual memory space but maps physical pages
only when needed, the size on disk shown by some utilities can be quite
large. Similarly, copying a database can take a long time. So we use a
different method of copying a PMGD database.
Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 - 
Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13252682/copying-a-1tb-sparse-file
Assume a database called pmgd_db at /home/user/
sudo apt-get install bsdtar     # this is used for doing the sparse copy
cd wherever_you_need_to_copy
bsdtar cvfz pmgd_sparse.tar.gz /home/user/pmgd_db
tar -xvSf pmgd_sparse.tar.gz
